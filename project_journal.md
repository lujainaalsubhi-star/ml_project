# Project Journal: Machine Learning System for Network Intrusion Detection

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning system to address a practical challenge: network intrusion detection. Utilizing the provided `train_test_network.csv` dataset, the system is designed to classify network traffic into various attack types or normal behavior. This aligns with Option 2 of the assignment specification, focusing on applying machine learning to real-world problems with real-world data.

## 2. Task Definition

### Objective
The primary objective is to build a classification model that can accurately identify different types of network intrusions (e.g., backdoor, ddos, dos, injection, mitm, password, ransomware, scanning, xss) as well as normal network traffic.

### Input and Output
**Input:** The system receives network flow data as input. Each instance in the `train_test_network.csv` dataset represents a network connection with various features such as source/destination IP and port, protocol, duration, byte counts, connection state, DNS queries, SSL information, and HTTP transaction details. These features are preprocessed to be suitable for a machine learning model.

**Output:** The system outputs a predicted class label for each network connection, indicating the type of activity (e.g., 'normal', 'backdoor', 'ddos', etc.). The output is a categorical prediction.

## 3. Machine Learning System Development

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
The `train_test_network.csv` dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features, along with several columns that are largely empty or contain unique identifiers. The preprocessing steps involved:

1.  **Column Dropping:** Columns identified as having too many missing values or being irrelevant for the initial model (e.g., `dns_query`, `ssl_version`, `ssl_cipher`, `ssl_subject`, `ssl_issuer`, `http_uri`, `http_user_agent`, `http_orig_mime_types`, `http_resp_mime_types`, `weird_name`, `weird_addl`, `weird_notice`) were dropped. This decision was made to simplify the initial model and avoid issues with sparse features or excessive cardinality.
2.  **Missing Value Imputation:** For numerical columns, missing values were imputed with the median of the respective column. For categorical columns, missing values were imputed with the mode.
3.  **Categorical Feature Encoding:** All remaining categorical features (excluding the target variables `label` and `type`) were converted into numerical representations using `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
4.  **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that no single feature dominates the learning process due due to its magnitude.

### 3.2 Model Selection and Training
A `RandomForestClassifier` was chosen for this multi-class classification task. Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. They are robust to overfitting, can handle a large number of features, and provide good performance on many datasets.

The model was trained on a split of the preprocessed data, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing. The `n_estimators` parameter was set to 100, indicating 100 decision trees in the forest. `random_state` was set for reproducibility, and `n_jobs=-1` was used to utilize all available CPU cores for faster training.

## 4. Model Evaluation and Refinement

### 4.1 Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated using:

*   **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances.
*   **Classification Report:** Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, offering a more detailed view of the model's performance across different attack types.
*   **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation was performed to assess the model's generalization capability and robustness. This helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on a particular train-test split.

### 4.2 Results
The initial evaluation on the test set yielded an accuracy of approximately 0.995. The classification report showed high precision, recall, and F1-scores for most classes, indicating strong performance in distinguishing between normal traffic and various intrusion types. The `mitm` (Man-in-the-Middle) attack type showed slightly lower metrics compared to others, suggesting it might be a more challenging class to detect or that it has fewer samples in the dataset.

Cross-validation results further supported the model's robustness, with a mean accuracy of approximately 0.9954 and a very low standard deviation (0.0002), indicating consistent performance across different folds.

### 4.3 Loss Function vs. Task Objective
For a classification problem, the `RandomForestClassifier` implicitly optimizes a loss function related to impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) during tree construction. While this directly aims to improve classification accuracy, the ultimate task objective is to effectively detect network intrusions in a real-world scenario. High accuracy is a good indicator, but in security applications, false positives (legitimate traffic classified as attack) and false negatives (attacks missed) have different costs. A high recall for attack classes is often prioritized to minimize missed threats, even if it means a slightly higher false positive rate. The classification report provides the necessary metrics (precision and recall) to analyze these trade-offs.

### 4.4 Reflections and Future Work
The current model demonstrates excellent performance. However, potential improvements and future work include:

*   **Feature Engineering:** Exploring more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, especially for time-series aspects of network traffic, could further enhance detection capabilities.
*   **Advanced Models:** Investigating other advanced machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) or deep learning approaches, could potentially yield even better results, especially for complex attack patterns.
*   **Imbalanced Data Handling:** If certain attack types are significantly underrepresented, techniques like SMOTE or adjusting class weights could be applied to improve their detection.
*   **Real-time Deployment Considerations:** For a practical system, considerations for real-time data streaming, model inference speed, and continuous learning would be crucial.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** More extensive hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV could be performed to find optimal model configurations.

## 5. Environment Setup and Data Pre-processing

The project requires Python 3.11 and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`
- `numpy`

These can be installed using pip:
`pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy`

The data preprocessing is handled by the `preprocess_data.py` script, which reads `train_test_network.csv`, cleans it, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical features. The `train_model.py` script then uses this preprocessed data to train and evaluate the `RandomForestClassifier`.
